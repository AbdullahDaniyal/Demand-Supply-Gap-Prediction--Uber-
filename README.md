# Demand-Supply-Gap-Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical demand and supply data of Uber to predict future gaps using various machine learning models. The predictions are aimed at aiding logistic optimizations in ride-hailing services.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression

Each model's performance is evaluated based on R-squared values and RMSE, with visualizations provided for an intuitive understanding of their predictive accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- `analysis/` - Jupyter notebooks or scripts with the analysis.
- `data/` - The dataset used for modeling (if publicly shareable).
- `images/` - Graphs and plots generated from the analysis.
- `models/` - Serialized models ready for use.

## How to Use
We did it on colab, you can use that or you can install necessary dependencies for it.

## Results
A summary of the findings from the different models and an explanation of the forecasted results.

## Contributing
Collaboration is at the heart of this project, and contributions are always welcome. If you have ideas for improvement or want to adapt the models for broader applications, we'd love to see your suggestions and work.

### Credits
This project is a collective effort, and I have the pleasure of recognizing my colleague Muhammad Usman Baig, whose insights and expertise have been invaluable. Together, we navigated the complexities of machine learning to address real-world problems.
